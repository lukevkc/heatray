## About The Project

Project aims to address the crucial need for reliable and efficient messaging in business systems. In such environments, the timely delivery of a large volume of emails and other messages is paramount. Ensuring the delivery of each message and maintaining a comprehensive historical record of sent communications is essential.
<br>
To tackle this challenge, we propose a solution consisting of a client plugin integrated into existing .NET applications and a lightweight and fast server-side application. The client plugin seamlessly connects to the server application using gRPC protocol, enabling efficient communication.
<br>
The server application, running on any suitable server, is designed to handle high volumes of message traffic with minimal system overhead. It stores message models in its database and processes them, adding comprehensive metadata collected during message handling.
Application is designed to operate within distributed systems, offering flexibility to run on any machine within the network. This capability allows for seamless integration into existing infrastructure setups, regardless of their complexity or geographical distribution.
<br>
By leveraging this solution, businesses can reliably deliver thousands of messages while maintaining a complete record of their communications history. Our system offers scalability, performance, and reliability, ensuring critical messages reach their destinations promptly and efficiently.
